geospatial-learn
============

geospatial-learn is a Python module for using scikit-learn and xgb models with geo-spatial data, chiefly raster and vector formats. 

The module also contains various fuctionality for manipulating raster and vector data as well as some utilities aimed at processing Sentinel 2 data.

The aim is to produce convenient, minimal commands for putting together geo-spatial processing chains using machine learning libs. Development will aim to expand the variety of libs/algorithms available for machine learning beyond the current complement.
