geospatial-learn
============

geospatial-learn is a Python module for using scikit-learn and xgb models with geo-spatial data, chiefly raster and vector formats. 

The module also contains various fuctionality for manipulating raster and vector data as well as some utilities aimed at processing Sentinel 2 data.

The aim is to produce a convenient, minimal commands for putting together processing chains. Development will aim to expand the variety of libs/algorithms available for machine learning beyond the current complement.

Project History
---------------

It is currently maintained voluntaliry by Dr Ciaran Robb, University of Leicester. The functionality was originally written as part of various research projects involving Earth observation & geo-spatial data. The module is at a very early stage at present and there is more material wrtten that has yet to be added.
