Welcome to geospatial-learn's documentation!
============================================

geospatial-learn is a Python module for using scikit-learn and xgb models with geo-spatial data, chiefly raster and vector formats.

The module also contains various fuctionality for manipulating raster and vector data.

The aim is to produce convenient, minimal commands for putting together geo-spatial processing chains using raster, vector and some machine learning libs. Development will aim to expand the variety of libs/algorithms available for machine learning beyond the current complement.
